HQ: Exorcists Hasegawa and Suzunashi, report.  
Tatsumi: Kyoto Exorcist Tatsumi Hasegawa reporting in!
Haruna: U-Um, Kyoto Exorcist Haruna Suzunashi reporting in!  We’re at the specified location, sir!
HQ: Good.  Multiple reports have confirmed the presence of Shutendoji, the Ogre King.  We’ve lost too many people corralling it in that cave; get in there, meet up with the other exorcists and exorcise it.  
Tatsumi: Yes, sir!  Tatsumi Hasegawa, reporting out!
Haruna: W-Wait, I want to ask them... something... 
Tatsumi: Whoops, sorry Haruna.  What were you going to ask?
Haruna: I wanted to ask about the other exorcists, and to see if they had any more details on the target... 
Tatsumi: Ehehehe... sorry about that.  Still, we’ll find out when we meet up with the others, right?  And as for Shutendoji, we can always ask later.  For now, we need to get into the cave!  Let’s go!  
Haruna: Tatsumi, w-we weren’t finished talking yet... !  He always rushes in like this...
