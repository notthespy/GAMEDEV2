-two people from one shrine (tank and mage), meet cleric and rogue later

Beginning of story has T&M leave temple to aid exorcism efforts in Kyoto (Kyoto Exorcists have been overstretched for the past 50 years due to large resurgence of horrors)

They do an intro mission and meet the chief of the exorcism bureau

An earthquake strikes in southern Kyoto damaging the southern temple, and T&M are sent to help rescue efforts (multiple minor monsters are present)

Other officials on scene redirect them towarc the temple, and a kid they try to find and bring to safety flees into the temple 

Along the way in the area they find the Cleric

T&M enter the temple and get drawn in by the kid, dealing with hazards such as rubble and a surprising amount of monsters  

Upon reaching the center of the temple, the kid reveals itself as a monster and attacks the party

They defeat it, but the fight breaks the seal of the temple, unleashing the first boss Suzaku

After TMC defeat/purify Suzaku, it says that other temples may be in danger and the party leaves

TMC return to HQ to learn that the shrines restrain the majority of the monsters in Japan, and that they cannot be allowed to fail like the southern one  

The party heads to the western temple at the advice of the local seer, and meet the ninja on the way (the ninja is searching for someone)  

They arrive in the western area and deal with someone blocking entry to the shrine (his cart is stuck); also monster-slaying around the area

They enter the temple and make their way through to come across a hooded figure undoing the seal in the temple

The party tries fighting him off and loses terribly, and the hooded man releases Byakko and leaves  

The party purifies/defeats Byakko, returns to the base and tells the chief about the hooded man

The chief tells them that even if the beasts once meant to protect the shrines are defeated/purified, the fact that the seal was undone weakens the entire thing

He sends them to the eastern temple to protect it and to gather information on the past from a nearby library in hopes of discovering a countermeasure

Local law enforcement and exorcists promise to protect the shrine, so the party heads to the library
