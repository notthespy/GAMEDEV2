Haruna: There are so many Monstrosities... it’s ridiculous... 
Tatsumi: I’m... I’m exhausted... How are you doing, Kyoko? 
Kyoko: Still tired.  Feet still killing me.  
Tatsumi: You look better than before, though.  
Kyoko: Yeah... I’m sorry about last time, with Orochi.  When I was young, my parents were killed by a snake-like Monstrosity.  Ever since, I’ve been terrified of them.  I thought it would be better if I became an Exorcist, but... that didn’t work at all.  So thank you both for supporting me back then.  It’ll take a while, but... I think I can make some progress.  
Haruna: Kyoko... 
Tatsumi: I’m glad you’re feeling better.  But if you ever need someone to support you - I’m here. 
Kyoko: Oh?  So you’ll be there for me at any time?  How embarrassing!  Do I need to find a white dress?  
Tatsumi: T-That’s not what I meant to say at all!  
Haruna: Tatsumi, this is a serious situation!  Stop f-f-flirting with Kyoko!  
Tatsumi: That’s not what’s going on at all!  Look, let’s get moving, okay?  
Kyoko: You got it!
