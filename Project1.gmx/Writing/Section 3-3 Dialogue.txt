Play before level 3-4

Tatsumi: This is it, isn’t it? 
Haruna: Yes; the Sesshouseki should be just ahead.  And in front of that is... 
Kyoko: The Nine-Tailed Fox.  
Tatsumi: This will be the toughest mission we have ever taken on.  Ahead of us is the deadliest Monstrosity in history, and we’ll likely be facing it alone.  However, I believe.  I believe in our power.  I believe in our ability to exorcise the Nine-Tailed Fox.  And most of all, I believe that we all get out of this alive.  Kyoto Exorcists, move out!  
Haruna: Right!  
Kyoko: Right! 

Play after defeat of Tamamo-no-Mae (fox)

Tatsumi: F-Finally... 
Kyoko: Haruna... contact HQ... 
Haruna: R-Right... Exorcist Suzunashi reporting in.  The Nine-Tailed Fox has been exorcised!  Requesting procedures for repairing the Sesshouseki!  
HQ: Excellent work, Exorcists.  I’ll narrate the ritual to you, so pay attention and do exactly as I say.  
Haruna: Right.  I-I see... so you make that sort of motion... 
HQ: Excellent, now adjust the ritual circle as you channel mana... 
Haruna: I-It worked... 
HQ: Superb work, Exorcist Suzunashi.  All three of you are deserving of praise for your efforts.  You are cleared from active duty for the foreseeable future for debriefing and recuperation.  
Tatsumi: Thanks... Kyoto Exorcist Tatsumi Hasegawa reporting out.  
Haruna: So that means that... 
Tatsumi: We’re free!  And I might not end up on probation again!  
Kyoko: I can finally take a bath!  
Haruna: There won’t be as many people in danger anymore!  They can finally go back to their homes!  
Tatsumi: The people can finally begin to live in peace again.  Team, I think it’s safe to say we’ve done well.  Mission clear!  
Haruna: Right!  
Kyoko: Right!
